    answer:
      "Drivers aged 17 and over with a valid UK driving licence can apply. We cover young drivers, those with convictions, and even learners (protecting the car owner’s no-claims discount). The vehicle must have a valid MOT, but you can get cover to drive to an MOT appointment.",

    answer:
      "Our temporary insurance is fully comprehensive, covering damage to your vehicle, third-party vehicles, and injuries in an accident.

  {
    title: "Do I need to notify the car owner?",
    answer:
