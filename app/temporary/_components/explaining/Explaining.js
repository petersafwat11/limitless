            Temporary car insurance is a short-term, flexible policy that
            provides fully comprehensive cover for driving a vehicle in the UK,
            ranging from one hour to 28 days. Ideal for situations like
            borrowing a car, test-driving a new vehicle, or covering a short
            trip, it offers the same protection as an annual policy without the
            long-term commitment. With Limitless Cover, young drivers, couriers,
            and those with convictions can quickly secure affordable insurance
            tailored to their needs, with instant quotes and hassle-free
            activation through our online platform.
